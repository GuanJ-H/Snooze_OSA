### Abstract
Approximately 25 million adults in the United States of America
alone suffer from obstructive sleep apnea, according to the
National Healthy Sleep Awareness Project. Obstructive Sleep
Apnea is a disorder that causes the patient to repeatedly stop
and start breathing during sleep.

##### Problem:

This diagnosis standard is incredibly time consuming and labor
intensive. It also puts the patient in an unfamiliar environment,
which can have an effect on the patientâ€™s ability to sleep for
proper diagnosis.

##### Solution:
To create low-cost, low-footprint sensor system so that patients
can perform a sleep study in a familiar environment for proper
OSA diagnosis.
